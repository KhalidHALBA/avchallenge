# B) Configuring the Experiment :

## B.1- UCEF Side
* clone the avchallenge repository in /home/vagrant. 
`git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/avchallenge.git -b feature/latest`

### B.1.a- UCEF VM Configuration  
#### B.1.a.i- Minimum Configuration Settings
* CPU : 4 cores
* RAM : 4 GB
#### B.1.a.ii- Networking
* Add NAT interface
* Add Host Only Interface
### B.1.b- Gateway Federate UDP socket Configuration 

* IGNITE and UCEF communicate over a UDP socket, each end sends and receives data. Make sure both ends are on the same subnet. The UDP socket is configured in a way that we need to tell UCEF the target system that hosts IGNITE. We use the UCEF Gateway Federate configuration file to set the target IP Address parameter, this configuration needs to be set in two locations  : 

- location 1) : /home/vagrant/avchallenge/ADS_generated/UCEFGateway/conf/UCEFGateway.json
- location 2) : /home/vagrant/avchallenge/ADS_deployment/conf/default/ucefgateway.json
- parameter to set : IGNITE IP

### B.1.c- Sampler & Lookahead Configuration

#### B.1.c.i- Sampler Configuration

* The sampler samples the FTP 75 drive cycle in a way that matches IGNITE's output time step. For a 10 HZ sampling rate the configuration is set in vehicle control federate as follows : 


- location 1) : /home/vagrant/avchallenge/ADS_generated/VehicleControl/conf/VehicleControl.json
- location 2) : /home/vagrant/avchallenge/ADS_deployment/conf/default/vehiclecontrol.json
- parameter to set : sampling_rate

![Image](https://i.ibb.co/BKBVsj7/11.png)


#### B.1.c.ii Lookahead Configuration

* The lookahead parameter describes the ability of the autonomous vehicle controller to anticipate speed and braking operations. It matches IGNITE's lookahead parameter. To modify on UCEF we use the "IGNITE_LOOKAHEAD" parameter in the following files : 


- location 1) : /home/vagrant/avchallenge/ADS_generated/VehicleControl/conf/VehicleControl.json
- location 2) : /home/vagrant/avchallenge/ADS_deployment/conf/default/vehiclecontrol.json

## B.2- IGNITE Side 

### B.2.a- FMU Preparation

* clone the avchallenge repository in C:\Users\vagrant\Desktop\avchallenge 
`git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/avchallenge.git -b feature/latest`


#### B.2.a.1- FMU Configuration : Important parameters 

We have to configure the following parameters before compiling the FMU : 

*  Refresh Rate
- The Refresh Rate value needs to be set on the FMU as well. It makes the socket ready to receive values at time durations equal to the refresh rate configured on UCEF's sampler and IGNITE's output time step.


*  Communication Delay 
- Use we IGNITE time to steer UCEF's drivce cycle generation. The time is carried in a UDP socket with a certain delay that needs to be compensated in order to match the native Drivecycle pattern. The communication_delay parameter enables the compensation of that time. It is set to 0.3 seconds in this experiment (measured delay).

#### B.2.a.2- FMU Compilation

`C:\Users\vagrant\Desktop\avchallenge\UCEF-IGNITE-FMU\fmusdk\fmu10\src\models>build_fmu cs drivecycle -win64`

### B.2.b- IGNITE Preparation

* Start IGNITE
* Load Vehicle Model after making a backup copy.
- SUV ELECTRIC : `C:\Program Files\Ricardo\2018.1\Products\IGNITE\Examples\Powertrain_library\Fuel_economy\SUV_electric\suv_electric.ignx`

### B.2.c- Load FMU 

The pictures below show numbered steps to follow for loading the FMU :

> Drag and Drop the Loaded FMU to the Model space and delete the native drivecycle modelica component.

### B.2.d- Modelica Breakout Module 

For IGNITE 2019.1 , we choose the DriveCycleBreakout built in module.

For IGNITE 2018.1 , We follow the same steps we have seen above to load the modelica Module except : 

> step 3 :  we choose "Library" instead of FMU
> step 5 :  we load TCPLib.mo instead of drivecycle.c 
> step 10 : we drag and drop

### B.2.e- Connecting Modules 

Connecting the modules will yield the following configuration :

### B.2.f- Configuring IGNITE 

We configure Simulation, FMU, and Vehicle Settings : 

#### B.2.f.1- Simulation Time and Output time step (refresh rate )

# C) Running the Experiment :


## C.1- IGNITE Side

### C.1.a-  Running IGNITE

After loading the modelica vehicle model and the FMU as well as the Modelica Breakout component and connecting/configuring all the elements properly we can run the experiment. 


* On the session pane, Right click on Model->Solutions->OCT_1 and hit run :

### C.1.b-  Data Viewing 



> when the simulation is over, RPost, IGNITE's analytics tool can be used to show the data : 

* This is how to launch it :
